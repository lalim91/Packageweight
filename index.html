    //it's not wrong to pass in a value like this to a function, in fact it is good.  Though usually we don't want to put so much code into the onclick handler below.  There are better ways to do it, but since we haven't covered those just yet, I'll say this:
    //have a function called display_cost(), inside it gather the weight from the input, call calculateCost to get the value, and then print the value into the div like you are doing below.

    function calculateCost(weight) {
        var ounces=weight*16;
        if (weight < 1) {
            return .2*ounces; //
        }
        if (weight > 1 && weight < 5) {
            return .4*ounces;
        }
        if (weight>5) {
            return .7*ounces;
        }
    }
    function displayCost() {
        document.getElementById('cost_calculation').innerHTML= calculateCost(document.getElementById('weight').value);
    }
    //consolelog(calculateCost(document.getElementById('weight').value))
